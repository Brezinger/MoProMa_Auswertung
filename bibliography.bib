 abstract = {The effect of chemical composition on microstructure and tensile properties of a series of low modulus Ti-Nb-Cu-Ni-Al alloys was studied. These alloys consist of primary micrometer-sized \textgreek{b}-Ti dendrites surrounded by intermetallic phases. The morphology of the intermetallic phases is strongly affected by composition. Due to the composite microstructure, the alloys exhibit a low Young's modulus (77-84GPa) together with a high yield strength of about 1000MPa as well as moderate tensile ductility. The results demonstrate that complete substitution of Al by Ti reduces the Young's modulus by 5{\%}. Increasing Nb content at the expense of Ti causes a significant improvement of tensile ductility.},

@article{Raab.2021,
 abstract = {The determination of structural loads plays an important role in the certification process of new aircraft. Strain gauges are usually used to measure and monitor the structural loads encountered during the flight test program. However, a time-consuming wiring and calibration process is required to determine the forces and moments from the measured strains. Sensors based on MEMS provide an alternative way to determine loads from the measured aerodynamic pressure distribution around the structural component. Flight tests were performed with a research glider aircraft to investigate the flight loads determined with the strain based and the pressure based measurement technology. A wing glove equipped with 64 MEMS pressure sensors was developed for measuring the pressure distribution around a selected wing section. The wing shear force determined with both load determination methods were compared to each other. Several flight maneuvers with varying loads were performed during the flight test program. This paper concentrates on the evaluation of dynamic flight maneuvers including Stalls and Pull-Up Push-Over maneuvers. The effects of changes in the aerodynamic flow characteristics during the maneuver could be detected directly with the pressure sensors based on MEMS. Time histories of the measured pressure distributions and the wing shear forces are presented and discussed.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to apply stress constraints to structural topology optimization problems with design-dependent loading. A comparison of mass-constrained compliance minimization solutions and stress-constrained mass minimization solutions is also provided. Although design-dependent loading has been the subject of previous research, only compliance minimization has been studied. Stress-constrained mass minimization problems are solved in this paper, and the results are compared with those of compliance minimization problems for the same geometries and loading. A stress-relaxation technique is used to avoid the singularity in the stress constraints, and these constraints are aggregated in blocks to reduce the total number of constraints in the optimization problem. The results show that these design-dependent loading problems may converge to a local minimum when the stress constraints are enforced. The use of a continuation method where the stress-constraint aggregation parameter is gradually increased typically leads to better convergence; however, this may not always be possible. The results also show that the topologies of compliance-minimization and stress-constrained solutions are usually vastly different, and the sizing optimization of a compliance solution may not lead to an optimum.},

 abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the design and experimental work of compliant wing and wingtip morphing devices conducted within the EU FP7 project NOVEMOR and to demonstrate that the optimization tools developed can be used to synthesize compliant morphing devices. Design/methodology/approach The compliant morphing devices were ?designed-through-optimization?, with the optimization algorithms including Simplex optimization for composite compliant skin design, aerodynamic shape optimization able to take into account the structural behaviour of the morphing skin, continuum-based and load path representation topology optimization methods and multi-objective optimization coupled with genetic algorithm for compliant internal substructure design. Low-speed subsonic wind tunnel testing was performed as an effective means of demonstrating proof-of-concept. Findings It was found that the optimization tools could be successfully implemented in the manufacture and testing stage. Preliminary insight into the performance of the compliant structure has been made during the first wind tunnel tests. Practical implications The tools in this work further the development of morphing structures, which when implemented in aircraft have potential implications to environmentally friendlier aircrafts. Originality/value The key innovations in this paper include the development of a composite skin optimization tool for the design of highly 3D morphing wings and its ensuing manufacture process; the development of a continuum-based topology optimization tool for shape control design of compliant mechanisms considering the stiffness and displacement functions; the use of a superelastic material for the compliant mechanism; and wind tunnel validation of morphing wing devices based on compliant structure technology.

 abstract = {Compliant four-bar mechanisms treated in previous works consisted of at least one rigid moving link, and such mechanisms synthesized for motion generation tasks have always comprised a rigid coupler link, bearing with the conventional definition of motion generation for rigid-link mechanisms. This paper introduces a new task called compliant-segment motion generation where the coupler is a flexible segment and requires a prescribed shape change along with a rigid-body motion. The paper presents a systematic procedure for synthesis of single-loop compliant mechanisms with no moving rigid-links for compliant-segment motion generation task. Such compliant mechanisms have potential applications in adaptive structures. The synthesis method presented involves an atypical inverse elastica problem that is not reported in the literature. This inverse problem is solved by extending the loop-closure equation used in the synthesis of rigid-links to the flexible segments, and then combining it with elastic equilibrium equation in an optimization scheme. The method is illustrated by a numerical example.},

@article{Stanko.2018,
 abstract = {In this work, a genetic algorithm was implemented to perform an airfoil shape optimization with constraints applied to the airfoil cross-sectional area and pitching-moment coefficient. Constraints are enforced through the use of an augmented Lagrange penalty function. The design variables are formed through a class shape transformation approach with orthogonal, polynomial basis modes. The use of an orthogonal basis provides decreased levels of multicollinearity in higher-order design spaces, while still maintaining the completeness of lower-order spaces. The optimization methodology is demonstrated on the tip airfoil of a UH-60A baseline rotor. The design trade-offs of a new tip airfoil are investigated where the optimized tip section shows improvements in forward-flight performance in exchange for a small reduction in the rotor's stall margin.},

@inproceedings{Kintscher.2013,
 abstract = {Because of the large potential of drag reduction natural laminar flow is one of the challenging aims of the current international aerospace research. For the achievement of the absolutely essential surface quality new concepts for the high lift system at the leading edge are required. Five years ago DLR started a new morphing activity aiming at a smart leading edge device [1]. The concept incorporates a flexible glass fibre structure of the leading edge which is actuated by conventional actuators and kinematic stations. The glass fibre structure is especially tailored to achieve a desired aerodynamic target shape and fully closed so that there are not steps and gaps for a high quality surface. In a first step a functional demonstrator was realized and tested in a ground test which is able to continuously alter the shape of a leading wing edge under wing bending loads. As a second step a European consortium of leading research groups and European aeronautic industry started the common project SADE in 2008 which aims to demonstrate the functionality of smart high lift devices in low speed wind tunnel tests. A functional full-scale demonstrator of 5m span and 3m chord is planned in the project. The paper gives a survey on the concept of the smart leading edge, the design of the wind tunnel demonstrator and on the recent results from the wind tunnel tests. The paper will focus on the validation of finite element calculations with the comparison of stress/strain data and the predicted deformations under aerodynamic loading.},

@book{Ashby.2005,
 abstract = {Understanding materials, their properties and behavior is fundamental to engineering design, and a key application of materials science. Written for all students of engineering, materials science and design, this book describes the procedures for material selection in mechanical design in order to ensure that the most suitable materials for a given application are identified from the full range of materials and section shapes available.   Fully revised and expanded for this third edition, Materials Selection in Mechanical Design is recognized as one of the leading texts, and provides a unique and genuinely innovative resource.   Features new to this edition . New chapters on topics including process selection, material and shape selection, design of hybrid materials, environmental factors and industrial design. . Online tutor resources -- fully worked Instructor's Manual, full color materials selection charts, image bank for lecture presentations. . Reader-friendly approach and attractive, easy to use two-color presentation. . The methods developed in the book are implemented in Granta Design's widely used CES Educational software.  Materials are introduced through their properties, materials selection charts (now available on line) capture the important features of all materials, allowing rapid retrieval of information and application of selection techniques. Merit indices, combined with charts, allow optimization of the materials selection process. Sources of material property data are reviewed and approaches to their use are given. Material processing and its influence on the design are discussed. New chapters on environmental issues, industrial engineering and materials design are included, as are new worked examples, exercise materials and a separate, online Instructor's Manual. New case studies have been developed to further illustrate procedures and to add to the practical implementation of the text.  *The new edition of the leading materials selection text *Expanded and fully revised throughout, with new material on key emerging topics, an even more student-friendly approach, and attractive, easy to use two-color presentation *Improved tutor resources, plus supporting online materials and Instructor's Manual},

@article{Grasso.2014,
 abstract = {In order to maximize the ratio of energy capture and reduce the cost of energy, the selection of the airfoils to be used along the blade plays a crucial role. Despite the general usage of existing airfoils, more and more, families of airfoils specially tailored for specific applications are developed. The present research is focused on the design of a new family of airfoils to be used for the blade of one megawatt wind turbine working in low wind conditions. A hybrid optimization scheme has been implemented, combining together genetic and gradient based algorithms. Large part of the work is dedicated to present and discuss the requirements that needed to be satisfied in order to have a consistent family of geometries with high efficiency, high lift and good structural characteristics. For each airfoil, these characteristics are presented and compared to the ones of existing airfoils. Finally, the aerodynamic design of a new blade for low wind class turbine is illustrated and compared to a reference shape developed by using existing geometries. Due to higher lift performance, the results show a sensitive saving in chords, wetted area and so in loads in idling position.},

@article{HolmbergErikandTorstenfeltBoandKlarbringAnders.2014,
 abstract = {We present a contribution to a relatively unexplored application of topology optimization: structural topology optimization with fatigue constraints. A probability based high-cycle fatigue analysis is combined with principal stress calculations in order to find the topology with minimum mass that can withstand prescribed variable-amplitude loading conditions for a specific life time. This allows us to generate optimal conceptual designs of structural components where fatigue life is the dimensioning factor. We describe the fatigue analysis and present ideas that make it possible to separate the fatigue analysis from the topology optimization. The number of constraints is kept low as they are applied to stress clusters, which are created such that they give adequate representations of the local stresses. Optimized designs constrained by fatigue and static stresses are shown and a comparison is also made between stress constraints based on the von Mises criterion and the highest tensile principal stresses. The paper is written with focus on structural parts in the avionic industry, but the method applies to any load carrying structure, made of linear elastic isotropic material, subjected to repeated loading conditions.},

 abstract = {Calculation procedures for viscous/inviscid analysis and mixed-inverse design of subcritical airfoils are presented. An inviscid linear-vorticity panel method with a Karman-Tsien compressiblity correction is developed for direct and mixed-inverse modes. Source distributions superimposed on the airfoil and wake permit modeling of viscous layer influence on the potential flow. A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.},

@article{daRochaSchmidt.,
 abstract = {A morphing gap cover concept for the longitudinal gap on the edge of aerodynamic control surfaces is presented. The gap cover is completely passive, all loads are transferred to the adjacent control surfaces. Aerodynamic losses, noise, and radar cross sections can potentially be reduced by this gap cover. Macroscopic material design and additive manufacturing are key factors that allow to create skin materials and sandwich structures that can perform large shear deformations while maintaining high in-plane tension stiffness and bending stiffness. The resulting gap cover is relatively stiff with regard to the aerodynamic loads but can be deformed with relatively low actuation forces. A detailed model of a large scale gap cover (transport aircraft scale) is shown as well as a small scale hardware demonstrator, intended for smaller scale aircraft like sailplanes.},
